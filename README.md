# PART C0: Biological Question + Hypothesis ----

#Do subfamilies (Viperinae and Crotalinae ) within the Viperidae family live in the same geographic region or different geographic regions?

#Viperidae is a large family of venomous snakes with 3 main sub-families (albeit 1 is very small). Within those sub-families is Viperinae and Crotalinae that are sister groups and are distinguished by the lack of (Viperinae) or presence of (Crotalinae) a heat-sensing pit organ. Given the distinguished morphological trait, I believe the sister groups would not share geographical regions as by evolutionary theory, Crotalinae developed the need to have a heat-sensing pit organ for a reason.

# to perform some functions like alignments or to plot a data the data shouldn't be null. In order to eliminate the empty data the function na.omit can be used. For example :
length(viper$nucleotides)
Fulltest <- na.omit(viper$nucleotides)
length(Fulltest)

#Viperidae has sub-families Viperinae and Crotalinae that are sister groups and are distinguished by the lack of (Viperinae) or presence of (Crotalinae) a heat-sensing pit organ. These subfamilies are represented in world map all over the countries.The map represents the subfamily Crotoalinae is mostly present in North America and approximately one-third of the South america and Eastern part of Asia and northern part of Asia. Viperinae subfamily mostly present in India, Western part of Europe and few countries in Africa continent.
